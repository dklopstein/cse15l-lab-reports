## My Tennis Journey:
*An account of the thing I enjoy the most in life.*

# 1. High School (2017-2019):
*There was no focus, just having fun.*

I started playing tennis the summer before high school and have been playing ever since. When I started, Novak Djokovic was my favorite player, so many of my strokes were modeled after him. However, because of a lack of muscle mass, they became more extreme than I would have liked.

# 2. Quarantine (2020-2021):
*The grind began, I wanted to look good.*
> "I have learnt to be even more patient." *Roger Federer*

The focus:
- transforming the forehand (western to eastern)
- transforming the backhand (semi to eastern)
- transforming the serve (body motion and arm lag)

*THE WALL*

I became obsessed with the thought of looking effortless as I played. My favorite players slowly started shifting to those I deemed elegant, or classy. These include, but are not limited to, Roger Federer and Grigor Dimitrov.

My top players that I model after now are:
1. Roger Federer
2. Carlos Alcaraz
3. Rafael Nadal

However, now I just code, because there's less time to practice. That doesn't mean I'm stopping though.

`# coding`

```
gettingBetter = 0
enjoyingTennis = True
while (enjoyingTennis):
  gettingBetter += 1
```
